# 🗺️ Starter Kit — Setup Tutorials

> Welcome! This guide takes you from **zero** to a **running VR development environment** — no prior experience required.

## What is this project?

The **ICAROS VR Teaching Platform** lets you build immersive VR worlds for the **Meta Quest 3**, controlled through body movement on an ICAROS fitness device. You'll write code that runs directly in the browser — no app store, no compilation, just save and refresh.

## ❓ What if I get stuck?

1. **Re-read the step** — every command has a ✅ verification to check if it worked
2. **Check the ⚠️ troubleshooting** below each step
3. **Ask David** — in class or via email
4. **Open a GitHub Issue** — [github.com/dweigend/simple_flight/issues](https://github.com/dweigend/simple_flight/issues)

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Level Creation

Once your environment is set up, you can use any AI coding agent to **build a new VR experience** step by step.

The project includes a cross-agent **`new-level` skill** (in `.agents/skills/new-level/`) that works with:

| Agent | How to invoke |
|-------|--------------|
| **OpenCode** | Point it to `.agents/skills/new-level/SKILL.md` or just ask "create a new level" |
| **Claude Code** | Type `/new_level my-level-name` |
| **Cursor / Copilot / Codex** | The agent auto-discovers `.agents/skills/new-level/` |

The skill guides you through:
1. **Naming** your experience and choosing movement type + visual elements
2. **Scaffolding** 5 files from the template with your choices applied
3. **Registering** in the catalog so it appears in the VR experience selector
4. **Verifying** everything compiles and runs

No copy-paste needed — the agent handles the boilerplate, you focus on the creative decisions.

## 📖 Already set up?

If you already have a development environment and just need the project dependencies (Bun, mkcert, ADB), see [docs/SETUP.md](../docs/SETUP.md).
